Experiments conducted for paper dissection 1 in CMU 15-780 SP21. The codebase included in the original paper was outdated and had many problems. This repo contains framework for:

* iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) with rewinding
* training a simple neural net (LeNet 300-100)
* dropout experiments
* training with MNIST and pubfig83 datasets
